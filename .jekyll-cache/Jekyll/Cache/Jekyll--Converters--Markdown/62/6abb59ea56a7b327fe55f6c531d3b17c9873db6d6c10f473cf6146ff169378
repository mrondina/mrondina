<p>Last week I was attending Adobe MAX in LA for my 6th consecutive year, not counting the year there wasnâ€™t one. It was one of my first conferences as a designer, and as such, I have some great memories. I love meeting new people, being inspired and catching up with old friends. It is, however, a big conference. So big, that I never seem able to get to all the sessions I really want to. Adobe must know this and records all the sessions for me to enjoy at my leisure. So, I was back in the office on the Friday after MAX and found myself watching James Victoreâ€™s, <a href="&quot;_How to Tap into Your Creative Voice and Make Work That Matters_&quot;"><em>How to Tap into Your Creative Voice and Make Work That Matters</em></a>.</p>

<p>As I listened/watched while working through some designs I had to catch up on, I heard James emphasizing putting yourself as a designer into the work you do. Without that personal touch, he goes on to stress, the work has no identity; no originality. He continues (Iâ€™m paraphrasing) â€œYou are unique, your voice and expereiences; unique. Your personality has to be a part of your work. The client is paying you for <em>your voice</em>â€. I realized that I had spent a large part of my career chasing designs that were interesting to me. I followed trends and styles that I wanted to try for the sake of the aesthetic. In short, I found myself asking, â€œWhat is my design style?â€. In my mind I went back through all the projects Iâ€™d worked on; those that had meant something to me. I found a few that were unique to me. I found sparks and ideas that reflected my character and passion. I couldnâ€™t find, however, the undercurrent of my personality in all that I did. I had examined my work and found it lacking a consistent voice.</p>

<p>Feeling the shortcoming of my work, I began on my odyssey to identify my personal design style. It also, rather conveniently, falls into a redesign of my blog and portfolio. So, over the next days and weeks, Iâ€™ll be exploring designs that mattered to me from my childhood until now. Iâ€™ll be posting and sharing what I find to help me analyze the elements of these designs and how they shape my personal taste and style. Iâ€™m not really sure what Iâ€™ll discover and I donâ€™t think this is a â€œonce-and-doneâ€ type of exploration.</p>
