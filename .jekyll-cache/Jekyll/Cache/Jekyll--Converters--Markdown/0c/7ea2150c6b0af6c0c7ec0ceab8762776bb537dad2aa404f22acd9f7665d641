<p>Last week I was attending Adobe MAX in LA for my 6th consecutive year, not counting the year there wasn’t one. It was one of my first conferences as a designer, and as such, I have some great memories. I love meeting new people, being inspired and catching up with old friends. It is, however, a big conference. So big, that I never seem able to get to all the sessions I really want to. Adobe must know this and records all the sessions for me to enjoy at my leisure. So, I was back in the office on the Friday after MAX and found myself watching James Victore’s, <a href="&quot;_How to Tap into Your Creative Voice and Make Work That Matters_&quot;"><em>How to Tap into Your Creative Voice and Make Work That Matters</em></a>.</p>
