## Overview

Creative IQ was one of the first projects I led as I joined data.ai. Part of the data collection was to gather different mobile ads that were being served across the different ad networks. Customers would then review these creatives, their types, and styles to discover the most performant ad creatives for different types of apps and games. Marketing teams found this information invaluable, but needed more contextual information to make better decisions. With the additional data and information, came a need to elevate our ad creatives product to match the level of some of our industry-first products; App IQ and Game IQ. The project included a major design overhaul, design iterations with user research to validate the best possible approach. The business goal was to be able to drive greater revenue from the product and make the features fit to the desired customer workflows.
