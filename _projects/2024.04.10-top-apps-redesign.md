## Overview

At data.ai, our core product, Intelligence, is a web-based Saas platform that delivers AI driven estimates for the global mobile market. A key piece of the platform is our Top Apps report suite, a set of tables and visualizations for analyses of the most important mobile metric estimates, rankings, demographics and performance across the globe. This case study will outline my design leadership of this project including strategy, design execution, executive review and cross functional collaboration and research prior to the full product launch.

### Full case study coming soon!
