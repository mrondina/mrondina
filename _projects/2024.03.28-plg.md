## Introduction

As an expansion of my role as Sr. Director Product Experience at data.ai, I took on responsibility for the product management and strategic direction of our product-led growth initiatives, encompassing a range of efforts including our inbound app data marketing pages, product-led free trial, and driving inbound product qualified leads. This case study explores the strategic initiatives undertaken to maximize the effectiveness of our free trial and unlock new revenue potential. Through collaborative execution, these initiatives have resulted in a 57% increase in new user trials, increased revenue pipeline of over $2MM, better new user activation and driving 2-times more engagement across our free prooducts.

At data.ai, our core product, Intelligence, is a web-based SaaS platform that delivers AI-driven estimates for the global mobile app market. The platform offers a freemium account, where the free tier provides basic app market metrics and limited historical data, while the paid version offers comprehensive analytics, advanced features, and deeper historical data access. This tiered approach allows potential customers to experience the platform's core value before committing to the full suite of features.

The company itself and its product growth is primarily sales-led, focusing on enterprise customers who require the advanced capabilities and complete dataset. While the paid version is the primary revenue driver, the free offering serves as a critical entry point for potential down-market customers, introducing them to data.ai's mobile market metrics estimates for both app usage and app store rankings, monetization and more.

Data.ai is the market leader for these metrics and as such, leads the space for its data quality and availability. This case study will explore the strategy, execution and results of delivering product-led growth from within a sales-led B2B SaaS company.

## Background

At data.ai, we offer a free version of our premier product. Our CEO and CRO challenged the product team to drive more down-market inbound leads using a free 10-day trial. The full project team included my dedicated Growth PM, two senior designers, and shared engineering resources led by a TPM from our engineering teams.

As Senior Director of Product Design & Growth, reporting to the CPO, I was leading the team's Product Led Growth (PLG) efforts, directly managing our PM of growth and collaborating with colleagues in sales and marketing to realize 2 key business outcomes:
1. Better qualified leads for inbound sales
2. Increased engagement from our free accounts

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Mismatch of Web Visitors and Core ICP
The marketing site did well in attracting a lot of traffic; 900,000 avg unique visitors per month, primarily driven through search to individual app performance summary pages. Of these visitors, approximately 9k-15k new accounts were created per week, but only about 16% of those new users remained active. It was clear that we had a mismatch between the users visiting our marketing pages and those that were creating accounts indication a mismatch. The users that created new accounts were clearly not in our Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).

### Challenge 2: Internal Organizational Resistance
With sales-led organization, quotas and financial compensation tied to those quotas were key motivators to realize new revenue. Aligning executive leadership and a growth strategy that enhanced the sales cycle without cannibalizing it would be key factors to the success of the project.

## Analysis

With the challenges clearly understood, I first wanted to get a clear landscape of the current trial efforts that were launched. There was a legacy trial experience currently reaching about 15% of all new free users. This was a full UI overlay tailored to specific user personas that provided video tutorials for our most popular Intelligence reports. This was a full screen modal that presented a list of short videos that were linked directly to the reports.

As I met with the squad, we analyzed the current performance of the existing trial and learned that less than 4% of all new users were watching the videos. We then discussed how we could get to the desired outcomes.

My Growth PM set our current baseline and built out the metric analysis. It was clear that a trial was a popular option, with most users activating their 10-day trial within 3 days of signup. Those that activated the 10-day had twice the overall engagement during and after the trial's 10-day window. It became clear that our goal was to increase trial activation in the first 2 days of signing up and to increase trial user engagement during the 10-day trial.

The team also benchmarked and researched analogous trial experiences from competitors, best in class B2B SaaS platforms and others. This research enabled us to set expectations of the best possible outcomes from a PLG trial offering.

## Strategy

With our baseline and our KPIs set, I laid out our strategy along with the KPI targets we would be tracking.

### Driving Trial Adoption
- **KPI**: Increase trial activation from 12% to 25%
- **Tools and Resources**:
  - New email journey
  - Updated onboarding
  - New prompts for those who haven't opted into trial, but have it available

### Driving Inbound Signups
- **KPI**: 15% more signups
- **Tools and Resources**:
  - Targeted emails for marketing pages visits without signup
  - New SEO landing page structured around trial CTAs

## Execution

The tools at our disposal included:
- A no-code/low-code in-product onboarding tool for guidance modals and messaging
- Email nurture flows for new free users
- The paid-only portion of the platform called "locked features"

During the first phases of experimentation, I didn't allocate engineering resources. I wanted the team to experiment without engineering to enable moving fast and disproving as many assumptions before we started making larger product changes.

I set up weekly reviews with the CPO and cross-functional leaders to measure our progress against the goals that we had set. Each week we measured the performance of our test group against our baseline metrics. Our KPIs were as follows:

### Key Performance Indicators

- Onboarding guide completion: 75% up from < 8%
- Sign ups to trial activations: 30% up from 12%
- 60d retention and engagement: 28% up from 16%
- Qualified inbound sales requests:
  - Increased from 45 to 180 Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) per month
  - Sales Qualified Lead (SQL) conversion rate improved from 12% to 28%
  - Average deal size for trial-originated leads was 1.8x higher than other inbound sources
  - Time from MQL to SQL reduced from 45 days to 28 days

### Implementation Phases

1. **Initial Optimization**
   - Shortened onboarding to 3 steps
   - Completion rates jumped from 24% to 80%
   - 2x higher 30-day retention
   - 4x higher 60-day activity rates

3. **SEO Recovery and Enhancement**
   - Addressed 70% traffic drop due to algorithm change
   - Redesigned pages focusing on market-leading features
   - Collaborated with SEO and marketing experts
   - Rebuilt marketing pages in under 2 months
   - Achieved 20% increase in SEO traffic
   - Realized 22% increase in new user signups

## Results and Impact

- SEO-driven inbound leads: +20%
- Trial activation: From 16% to 36% (best in class for B2B SaaS)
- Trial activation on locked feature screens: +640%
- Sales pipeline from trial users: 3x increase
- User activity during and after trial: 4x increase

## Conclusion

The execution of a product-led growth strategy at data.ai illustrated to both marketing and product teams that enhancing marketing content, email nurture flows, and in-product onboarding can significantly drive inbound sales and improve engagement among free users. This approach led to a substantial increase in trial activations from 12% to 30% and improved onboarding completion rates to 80%. 

These initiatives resulted in a 25% boost in email referral traffic and a 22% rise in new user signups. This collaborative effort empowered the sales development and inbound sales teams to expand their reach and uncover new opportunities in down-market segments. The success of this initiative hinged on the unwavering commitment of the product, marketing, and sales organizations to work cohesively towards shared goals.
