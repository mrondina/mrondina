<div class="post-content"><p><em>Weekly Wrap up<br />
</em></p>
<p>Another week gone by and I'm one week closer to the final delivery of my project. At the start of this week, I was ready to declare defeat and prepare myself to retake the course in the winter. My application wasn't working properly and I couldn't seem to get the right parts and pieces talking to one another to function properly. I was also keenly aware that I was a solid 2 weeks behind on my development. I was stripping features to reach the core of the application's concept.</p>
<p><em>Getting by with a little help from my friends</em></p>
<p>So, as I faced defeat and spent a couple sleepless nights trying to resign myself to my self-made predicament, I posted a tweet that I could use some help. I have a number of friends that are experts in Flex programming and some who are Adobe employees. It was a desperate call for help that I wasn't sure anyone would answer. If anyone did, I wanted them to answer because they wanted to and not because I called them and the felt obligated.</p>
<p>One such person responded with a phone call and helped me through the road blocks that I was facing. I was relieved, I was ecstatic, and he went above and beyond the expected and provided working examples, links and additional advice. By Wednesday, my alpha build was working, and I started to feel like I might make it after all.</p>
<p>By the end of the week, most of my core functionality was in place and ready to be implemented. I'm still having to lose features, but I can easily add them back later on. There are still some difficult and long days ahead, as I found out with image parsing and loading, but I'm feeling much more confident in my problem solving and strategic planning.</p>
<p>As a side note, I did have to rewrite my authentication programming, since security protocols required it, but I found a solid example to build from (see below)</p>
<p><em>Linkage</em></p>
<p>This week had lots of links.</p>
<p><a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/as3/dev/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d118a9b90204-7ea8.html" target="_blank">Regular Expressions in AS3<em></em></a> - I'm using this to parse text to find links and urls. I'll use it later to parse user names</p>
