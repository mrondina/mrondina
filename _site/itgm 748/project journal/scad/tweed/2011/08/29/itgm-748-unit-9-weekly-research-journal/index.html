<div class="post-content"><p><em>The busiest week yet...</em></p>
<p>This was quite the week. I started with the list of my priority tasks, including their ranking of importance. This was one of the smoothest sailing weeks I've had, despite having so much to do. I started with building out the last pieces of functionality in my app, as well as starting to look for good resources for what I would face later on.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_45" align="aligncenter" width="273"]<a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/images/Screen-shot-2011-08-29-at-4.06.32-PM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-45" title="final prioritized task list" alt="" src="http://localhost:4000/blog/images/Screen-shot-2011-08-29-at-4.06.32-PM-273x300.png" width="273" height="300" /></a> that's a lot to do![/caption]</p>
<p>As I looked and planned for the amount of time I had to work and the number of tasks and my estimates for completion, it was painfully obvious that there wasn't enough time in the day. So, I planned on taking some time off work (Friday) to focus and move the project forward.</p>
<p>For the first time since the start of this project, I was running ahead all week! I got stumped once or twice, but was able to make up time later on. There were many nights where I would get stuck on an issue, go to bed, only to get up 10 minutes later to try some other methods. I was so wrapped around solving my bugs that I couldn't rest :)</p>
<p>By Friday, I was working on the last bits of logic and connections necessary to get it all working. So, Friday evening was set aside for skinning the components and final graphic design. Back when I started the project, I had given myself a week to do the design, and now I was left with roughly 12 hours! I had a solid idea in mind, though, so, it went relatively well once I started.</p>
<p>So, without much more chatter, here are some of the design elements</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_46" align="aligncenter" width="480"]<a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/images/title_screen.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-46" title="activate main screen" alt="" src="http://localhost:4000/blog/images/title_screen.png" width="480" height="854" /></a> The home screen of the app to activate[/caption]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I'm really happy with the way the application is coming along. There are still bugs and errors that need to be fixed, but I've got a solid working beta to build on.</p>
<p><em>Special Thanks</em></p>
<p>I would be completely self-centered if I didn't mention how much help <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/john__olson" target="_blank">John Olson</a> has been to me through the entire build and programming process. His insight into best practices, components, and the Flex framework have been invaluable. His generosity in his time and patience as he explained why things work the way they do and how best to approach problems was a life-line that came unlooked for.</p>
<p>Thank you, John.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/garthdb" target="_blank">Garth Braithwaite</a> was another source of Flex insights. His willingness to talk code when I hadn't intended to (it was always on my mind :) ) got me through a tight spot.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/NapmasterC" target="_blank">Craig Overman</a> was always willing to help me walk through logic and breakdown the code to its simplest bits. His brain just works that way!</p>
