<div class="post-content"><p>This was a week that was not as much research as it was creating and working on the paper prototype. The paper prototype came out fairly well, and I was able to test the design and get my initial feedback.</p>
<p><em>Paper Prototype</em></p>
<p>For the paper prototype, I used a sketchbook I have that has the outline of what looks like an android phone. The outline enabled me to get rough proportions of the UI and to work through the rough design before moving on to the wireframe.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_30" align="alignnone" width="155"]<a href="http://www.markrondina.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Tweed-stream-screen.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-30" title="Tweed-stream-screen" alt="" src="http://www.markrondina.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Tweed-stream-screen-155x300.png" width="155" height="300" /></a> paper prototype main feed screen[/caption]</p>
<p><em>Testing the prototype</em></p>
<p>With the paper prototype created, I then gathered some testers. I bribed some co-workers into testing by offering to buy lunch. I had about 4 testers, which is not as many as I would have liked, but I had a good mix of frequent twitter users as well as those unfamiliar with how twitter works. The test provided a lot of very useful information regarding the UI design. I'm now working on changes to the UI as well as adding in a couple of features and screens that were not included, but were consistently requested or expected during the test.</p>
<p><em>Risk Assessment</em></p>
<p>This week's assignment also included a risk assessment. It was a good exercise, but I was having a hard time recognizing what is working well with my project. It is still early in the process of development, so I haven't hit the full-blown coding yet. Working on the risk assessment did help me realize that I have a lot of questions regarding development that will need to be answered. The coming week I will begin to focus on testing bits of code for validity.</p>
<p><em>Research Links</em></p>
<p>I relied this week on the books that I have used in previous classes to develop and test the prototype. Each provides great resources and advice for working through the prototype user testing and moving into development.</p>
