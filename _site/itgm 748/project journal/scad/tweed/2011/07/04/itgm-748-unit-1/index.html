<div class="post-content"><p>This was a much busier week, but that was to be expected. My wife's due date was looming, and although we hoped our little girl would come early, she arrived 2 days late, throwing a bit of a wrench into my project development.</p>
<p><em>My progress so far</em></p>
<p>The progress so far has been a little slow going. My final project, named "Tweed", still has too many loose ends where concrete details should be. For example, I got stuck working out license issues on my Adobe software, which will be the building tool for the application. I spent time this week researching alternatives in the event that I couldn't get my software working again. I looked again at <a href="http://www.fdt.powerflasher.com/developer-tools/fdt/home/" target="_blank">Powerflasher's FDT</a>, but in the end was able to reactivate my Adobe software.</p>
<p>Architecture wise, I'm still leaning heavily toward using FlashBuilder, specifically the compile to iOS and Android features for the development. I realize there are some drawbacks, namely performance and application hooks to native hardware, but the efficiency I gain by using a familiar development environment and language var outweigh any other drawbacks. Plus with the recent release of the AIR 2.7 SDK, there are significant improvements to publishing and deployment.</p>
<p>A friend recommended <a href="http://www.sencha.com/" target="_blank">Sencha</a> as a possible framework, but my limited experience with Javascript and my limited time to complete the project with the new baby and upcoming travel have ruled it out. I would like to explore a transition to the Sencha framework down the road, but that will have to come later.</p>
<p><em>Project Timeline</em></p>
<p>I worked out the project timeline as follows:</p>
<p><!-- 		@page { margin: 0.79in } 		P { margin-bottom: 0.08in } --></p>
<ul>
<li>Week 1 – researching mobile frameworks and possible alternatives to AS3 and proposal writing</li>
<li>Week 2 – application flow diagram and basic wireframe as well as requirements and application specifications fully detailed. The specs will be divided between “must have” and “nice to have if time permits”</li>
<li>Week 3 – continued work on layouts and design ideas as well as some early user tests using sketches to determine most effective layout</li>
<li>Week 4 – a working early build of connecting and interpreting the API for Twitter, Bitly, and the image delivery services (yfrog)</li>
<li>Week 5 – general debugging and troubleshooting for learned APIs. Early performance testing on two sample devices (iPhone 3Gs and Droid2)</li>
<li>Week 6 – Alpha build of application with basic color scheme in place, but without final graphics. Core functionality built and tested</li>
<li>Week 7 – Testing of alpha build and debugging</li>
<li>Week 8 – Final graphic development and performance testing for GUI with optimization</li>
<li>Week 9 – User testing and tweaking</li>
<li>Week 10 – final build and delivery</li>
</ul>
<p>It is aggressive, but will be necessary if I'm to complete the project on time. I'm a little concerned about making sure the functionality is solid as well as the final polish. In the past, these projects seem to throw a particular problem that can sometimes hang me up and then I don't feel like I've fully finished the project as I wanted. Creating the core features and the desired features will be critical to the success.</p>
<p>Overall I'm excited to finally be beginning the project that I've had on my mind for so long now.</p>
